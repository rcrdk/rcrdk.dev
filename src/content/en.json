			"<strong>My name is Ricardo</strong>, I am 29 years old, and I live in Timbó, Santa Catarina, Brazil. I am a <strong>detail-oriented, persistent, and coffee-driven person.</strong> Besides coding, I am <strong>passionate about music</strong> — my playlists range from pop, rock, MPB, indie, disco, and many more. I’m a fan of the queen, the woman, <strong>Madonna.</strong> I’m also a <strong>Stephen King</strong> constant reader and a binge-watcher of <strong>series and brazilian novelas</strong>. I have a special fondness for everything that brings back the past.",
			"<strong>Technology has fascinated me from an early age.</strong> My curiosity about the web began in the early 2000s as I explored websites, Orkut, MSN, and, of course, slowly downloaded music over dial-up internet. I took <strong>computer and hardware maintenance courses</strong>, but it was a game — among many others — that truly sparked my passion for development: <strong>The Sims.</strong>",
			"I first played it on the old yellowed computers at school and spent years immersed in the life simulator. Over time, I got involved in building and sharing houses and worlds from the game, maintaining a blog on Blogger, just like many other players did. That was when <strong>I discovered the ability to edit themes and tweak the source code.</strong> Even without fully understanding what I was doing, I dived into it and fell in love with the process. A few years later, <strong>it all started making sense.</strong>",
			"In 2011, I took a <strong>Delphi</strong> course, where only two students completed the program — I was one of them. After all, I am persistent. This course led to a small program I developed to handle the student council elections at my school, marking <strong>my first functional project.</strong>",
			"In 2013, I moved to Timbó and began my professional journey at <strong>Sou Digital</strong>, where I started as an apprentice and was later hired as a <strong>front-end developer.</strong> I worked with <strong>HTML, CSS, and jQuery</strong>, eventually learning some <strong>PHP and Laravel</strong>, always striving to improve my work. Over the years, I refined my knowledge, sharpened my eye for <strong>code, design, and accessibility, and delivered high-quality projects.</strong> I also worked on web apps and <strong>e-commerce platforms.</strong>",
			"At the same time, between 2014 and 2017, I pursued a degree in <strong>Advertising and Marketing</strong>. Although I never worked directly in this field, the degree added a lot of value to my work, providing insights into <strong>design, marketing, consumer behavior, and technology.</strong>",
			"From 2019 onwards, as I transitioned to <strong>remote work</strong>, I took the opportunity to dive deeper into my studies and enhance my skills in <strong>React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, and Laravel.</strong> Today, I work as a front-end developer at <strong>Meu Rosinha</strong> while also being involved in other projects. My main focus is working with the <strong>React</strong> ecosystem, but I remain open to exploring <strong>other frameworks</strong> or even mobile development with <strong>React Native</strong>, which I am currently learning. On the back-end, <strong>Node.js</strong> has become a natural complement to <strong>Next.js</strong> or event using on of its frameworks like <strong>Fastify</strong>, while <strong>PHP and Laravel</strong> serve as more of a backup solution when needed.",
			"<strong>In the future,</strong> my goal is to continue growing as a developer, exploring <strong>new technologies,</strong> and getting involved in challenging projects where I can leave a meaningful mark. While my focus remains on front-end development, I am always looking for new tools and best practices to expand my skill set. <strong>I want to collaborate with innovative teams, share knowledge, and contribute to the creation of products that truly make a difference.</strong> I strive to always keep moving forward—one day at a time, one line of code at a time."

			"My name is Ricardo, I am 29 years old, and I live in Timbó, Santa Catarina, Brazil. I am a detail-oriented, persistent, and coffee-driven person. Besides coding, I am passionate about music — my playlists range from pop, rock, MPB, indie, disco, and many more. I’m a fan of the queen, the woman, Madonna. I’m also a Stephen Kings constant reader and a binge-watcher of series and brazilian novelas. I have a special fondness for everything that brings back the past.",
			"Technology has fascinated me from an early age. My curiosity about the web began in the early 2000s as I explored websites, Orkut, MSN, and, of course, slowly downloaded music over dial-up internet. I took computer and hardware maintenance courses, but it was a game — among many others — that truly sparked my passion for development: The Sims.",
			"I first played it on the old yellowed computers at school and spent years immersed in the life simulator. Over time, I got involved in building and sharing houses and worlds from the game, maintaining a blog on Blogger, just like many other players did. That was when I discovered the ability to edit themes and tweak the source code. Even without fully understanding what I was doing, I dived into it and fell in love with the process. A few years later, it all started making sense.",
			"In 2011, I took a Delphi course, where only two students completed the program — I was one of them. After all, I am persistent. This course led to a small program I developed to handle the student council elections at my school, marking my first functional project.",
			"In 2013, I moved to Timbó and began my professional journey at Sou Digital, where I started as an apprentice and was later hired as a front-end developer. I worked with HTML, CSS, and jQuery, eventually learning some PHP and Laravel, always striving to improve my work. Over the years, I refined my knowledge, sharpened my eye for code, design, and accessibility, and delivered high-quality projects. I also worked on web apps and e-commerce platforms.",
			"At the same time, between 2014 and 2017, I pursued a degree in Advertising and Marketing. Although I never worked directly in this field, the degree added a lot of value to my work, providing insights into design, marketing, consumer behavior, and technology.",
			"From 2019 onwards, as I transitioned to remote work, I took the opportunity to dive deeper into my studies and enhance my skills in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, and Laravel. Today, I work as a front-end developer at Meu Rosinha while also being involved in other projects. My main focus is working with the React ecosystem, but I remain open to exploring other frameworks or even mobile development with React Native, which I am currently learning. On the back-end, Node.js has become a natural complement to Next.js, while PHP and Laravel serve as more of a backup solution when needed.",
			"In the future, my goal is to continue growing as a developer, exploring new technologies, and getting involved in challenging projects where I can leave a meaningful mark. While my focus remains on front-end development, I am always looking for new tools and best practices to expand my skill set. I want to collaborate with innovative teams, share knowledge, and contribute to the creation of products that truly make a difference. I strive to always keep moving forward—one day at a time, one line of code at a time."

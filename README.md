# 👋🏻 Hi, there! 
This is the repo of my [personal website](https://rcrdk.dev/). It took a long time to get it done, but here it is. It's in constant development, so new updates will come when you least expects. Hope you enjoyed!

## ⚠️ Spoiler Alert
There are some easter eggs in this project.

- ☃️ If your mouse doesn't move for over 10 seconds, a screensaver will be displayed with a random selection of gifs, enjoy!
- 😵 Speaking of gifs, try to access some invalid page route, it's even coolest if you access it on your desktop. 
- 🔮 On special and selected dates you may get a message with some confetti. You can check the dates on code or you can wait until one of those days come, but I would never recommend that.
- 💻 Did you opened DevTools already?
- ⌨️ Shortcuts:
    - `control` + `t`: toggle color theme.
    - `1` to `6`: navigate through sections.
